# 📈 Career Track: Data Engineer with Python
🧠 Here is all my work I am doing while learning to become Data Engineer. 

Most of the projects are based on the tasks from the ['Career Track: Data Engineer with Python'](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-engineer-with-python) from www.datacamp.com

🏁 - course finished

🔖 - course in progress

If there is no link for the course name that means I haven't started it yet.
