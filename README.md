# ðŸ“ˆ  Data Engineer with Python
ðŸ§  All tasks I carry out on courses and projects related to Data Engineering.

Most of them are based on the tasks from the ['Career Track: Data Engineer with Python'](https://github.com/monikaglazz/Data_Engineering_with_Python/blob/main/Track_description.pdf) from www.datacamp.com

['Career Track: Data Engineer with Python' - certificate](https://github.com/monikaglazz/Data_Engineering_with_Python/blob/main/Data_Engineer_Career_Track_certificate.pdf)

If I have completed the course listed below, it means that you can find a confirmation certificate in the corresponding folder.
